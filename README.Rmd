The goal of SwapPricer is to allow you to price a book of interest rate swaps (IRS).
IRS is the most traded over the counter financial derivative in the world and now
you can easily price it in R. More details on the financial characteristics of
this contract can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_swap)

Please note that as at version 1.0.1 the toolbox is able to price using just a 
one-curve framework but is able to price multiple currencies (ie. CHF, EUR, GBP,
JPY and USD) and any convention in terms of coupon frequency, day count convention.

**We are working to introduce OIS Discounting in the next releases**

## Installation

For now, you can just install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavideMagno/SwapPricer")
```
## Example

The main function of the toolbox is `SwapPortfolioPricing` which uses just three
inputs:

1) A table with the characteristics of the swap, like the following one

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::kable(SwapPricer::swap.basket, caption = "Input Portfolio", "html")
```

2) The date at which the swaps are being priced

3) As many interest rate lists as per the currencies in the swap portfolio.
The list is made of a string with the code of the currency and a with a tibble
with the discounting factor curve with two columns: Dates and Discount Factors (df). 
Here is an example of interest rate list:

```{r, message = FALSE}
SwapPricer::EUR.curves
```

Examples of items 1 and 3 have been provided with the package.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(SwapPricer)
today <- lubridate::ymd(20190415)
SwapPricer::SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, today, 
                                 SwapPricer::EUR.curves, SwapPricer::GBP.curves,
                                 SwapPricer::USD.curves) 
```

This function returns a table that can be easily used for reporting like below

```{r example_table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(SwapPricer)
today <- lubridate::ymd(20190415)
SwapPricer::SwapPortfolioPricing(SwapPricer::swap.basket, today, SwapPricer::EUR.curves, SwapPricer::GBP.curves, SwapPricer::USD.curves)  %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars("clean.mv","dirty.mv","accrual.pay","accrual.receive","pv01"),
                   formattable::comma) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars("par"), formattable::percent) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Pricing results", "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed","responsive"))
```

## Learning More ##

The vignettes are a great place to learn more about SwapPricer.

If you are installing from github and want the vignettes, you'll need to run the following 
commands first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("DavideMagno/SwapPricer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(SwapPricer)
```

You can then access them from R with the `vignette()` command
