Title: Pricing of financial interest rate swaps in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Davide Magno
Maintainer: Davide Magno <davide.magno@curiousfrm.com>
Description: This toolbox calculates the price and risk characteristics of 
    interest rate swaps, a widely used financial instrument. Please refer to the
    vignettes to understand how to setup the input data and run the main 
    routines. For the current version of the toolbox, we recommend to price 
    solely standard EUR swaps. In the next releases we will extend to the major
    currencies with non standard coupon conventions and dual-curve construction.
